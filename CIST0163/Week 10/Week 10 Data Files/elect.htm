            <h2>Oersted's Lucky Lecture</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, electricity and magnetism
               had been seen as two entirely different forces. This all changed thanks
               to Hans Christian Oersted's lucky lecture.</p>
            <p>Oersted had been using a strong battery in one of his lectures, and as
               he concluded his talk he placed a current-carrying wire over a compass.
               To his surprise, the compass begain to move quickly from the north
               direction to the east directon, as if it were in the presence of an
               intense magnetic field. Oersted reversed the flow of the electric
               current and the compass promptly began pointing west.</p>
            <p>As soon as Oersted announced his discovery, physicists all over Europe
               duplicated the experiment and quickly realized that electricity and
               magnetism were two aspects of the same force. Today we refer to
               this force as electromagnetism, thanks, in part, to Oersted's lucky
               lecture.</p>
