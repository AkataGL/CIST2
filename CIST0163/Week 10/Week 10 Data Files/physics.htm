      <p>Newton deduced the principles of gravitation after seeing an apple fall.
         We don't sell apples, but we do sell wonderful physics kits to help you
         teach science in a fun and interesting way. Choose from some of the products
         below, or order one of our catalogs for a complete list.</p>

         <h2>Newton and the Apple</h2>
         <p>Okay, we all know the story of Isaac Newton getting hit in the head with
            the apple, but is this story true? Well, not exactly, but there's more
            truth to it than you might think</p>
         <p>Newton grew up on a farm, where he certainly saw many apples fall from
            trees. As a young man, Newton recalled those apples and wondered whether
            the same force that causes apples to fall would account for the motion
            of the moon across the sky.</p>
         <p>Newton applied his newly-discovered mathematical technique, calculus
            (he called his technique fluxions) to the problem and deduced that, if
            his assumption was correct, the moon would orbit the Earth every 29.5
            days. That's pretty close to the actual figure of 27.3 days.</p>
         <p>So, no, Newton did not get hit with an apple, but he did get hit with
            a pretty good idea - thanks to an apple.</p>
