                    teaching at the master level tuition

                <h2>Lessons</h2>
                <p>Weekly private lessons are 30, 45, or 60 minutes in length. Priority scheduling is given to current
                    students and enrollments received before August 1st. Enrollment is on-going and tuition is pro-rated
                    for a mid-year start.</p>
                <p>Tuition includes 29 private lessons and 5 ensemble experiences from September through June (see our
                    calendar for exact dates). There are two payment options available-Monthly and Semester. Monthly
                    payments are due the 1st of each month
                    from August through May. Semester payments are discounted and are due August 1st and January 1st. A
                    late fee is applied for past due accounts on the 7th of the month. Students beginning study mid-year
                    will have their tuition prorated.</p>
                <p>It is the goal of Young Notes that no student be unable to study the arts due to financial
                    challenges. Our Scholarship Program provides financial assistance to students who are unable to pay
                    full tuition.</p>
