    <h2>Quality Juggling and Circus Props</h2>
<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>If you're looking for high-quality, hand-crafted juggling and circus products, the J-Prop Shop is the store for you. I've designed and built props for the past 35 years, and my products have been used by professional entertainers and hobbyists throughout the world. Our prices are reasonable and our quality is excellent.

    <h2>Specials This Month</h2>
    
    <p>The following devil sticks are available at a special discount for the entire month of May:</p>
    
        <p><b>Stick ($19.95)</b> The easiest stick to learn with, but "grippy" enough for the most demanding tricks. Comes in red, green, and blue.</p>
        <p><b>Flower Stick ($24.95)</b> A graceful stick with colored tassels. Flower Sticks float slowly, making them ideal for beginners.</p>
        <p><b>Master Stick ($39.95)</b> Our most popular stick is shorter and heavier for fast play and more advanced tricks. Each Master Stick is available in custom colors.</p>
        <p><b>Glow Stick ($29.95)</b> The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a fire stick).</p>
    
    <h2>Quality Tested</h2>
    
    <p>Every item I create is checked and tested before being shipped out to assure perfect quality. I take pride in every one of my juggling props and I want my customers to feel that same pride.
